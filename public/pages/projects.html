                            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                            <p>
                                I developed a comprehensive, full-stack web application from the ground up to serve as the digital backbone for CEL Harrisonburg, a professional organization for Latino entrepreneurs and business owners. The platform streamlines member management, automates event organization, and provides a secure, interactive hub for community engagement, replacing manual processes with an efficient, scalable digital solution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As the sole developer, I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle, including system architecture, database design, backend development, frontend user-interface design, and security implementation.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <h4>Key Features & Technical Highlights</h4>
                            <p>
                                This application was built with a focus on security, real-time functionality, and ease of use for both members and administrators.
                            </p>
                            <h6>1. Secure Authentication & Role-Based Access Control</h6>
                            <ul>
                                <p>
                                    I implemented a robust user registration and login system using Firebase Authentication, supporting both traditional email/password and Google OAuth for a seamless user experience. The system is built with role-based access, distinguishing between standard members and administrators, ensuring that sensitive management features are protected.
                                </p>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <h6>2. Custom-Built Admin Dashboard</h6>
                            <ul>
                                <p>
                                    A key feature of the project is a comprehensive, secure admin panel. This dashboard empowers the CEL Harrisonburg team to:
                                </p>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Manage Business Approvals: </strong>
                                    Review new business submissions, with options to approve, deny, or edit their status.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Moderate Community Feedback: </strong>
                                     View and manage submissions from the "Comparte Tu Voz" form, categorized by status (Pending, In Progress, Complete).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Oversee User Data: </strong>
                                    View and manage the member directory and profile.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <h6>3. Real-Time Database & Content Management</h6>
                            <ul>
                                <p>
                                    Using <strong>Cloud Firestore,</strong> the application's data is synchronized in real-time. This allows for dynamic features such as:
                                </p>
                                <li>
                                    An interactive events calendar that is always up-to-date.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    User profiles that can be edited and are instantly reflected across the site.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Live notification badges in the admin panel that update automatically when new items require review.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <h6>4. Secure File Management System</h6>
                            <ul>
                                <p>
                                    I architected a secure file storage system using <strong>Firebase Storage</strong> for user profile pictures and business logos. This includes:
                                </p>
                                <li>
                                    A structured, multi-level folder system that ties each file directly to both the <em>userId</em> and the specific <em>businessId</em>.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Strict Firebase Storage security rules that ensure a user can only upload or delete files within their own designated folders, preventing unauthorized access.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <h6>5. Third-Party API Integration via Serverless Backend</h6>
                            <ul>
                                <p>
                                    To display a live Instagram feed without compromising security, I developed a serverless backend using <strong>Firebase Cloud Functions</strong>. The function acts as a secure intermediary, safely using a secret API token on the server-side to fetch posts and then passing the data to the frontend. This prevents exposing sensitive keys on the client-side.
                                </p>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <h4>Technology Stack</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Frontend: </strong>
                                    Vue.js (Composition API), Vue Router
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Backend & Database: </strong>
                                    Firebase (Cloud Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage, Cloud Functions)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Styling: </strong>
                                    Bootstrap 5, SCSS
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Server-Side Logic: </strong>
                                    Node.js (for Cloud Functions)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Security: </strong>
                                    Firebase Security Rules, Google reCAPTCHA
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <h4>Outcome</h4>
                            <p>
                                The result is a scalable, professional, and secure platform that empowers CEL Harrisonburg to manage its community efficiently and provides immense value to its members. The application serves as a central point for networking, resources, and communication, directly supporting the organization's mission to strengthen the local Latino business community.
